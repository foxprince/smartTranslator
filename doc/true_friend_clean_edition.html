                    <p>Janetta was the music governess—a brown little thing of no particular importance, and Margaret Adair was a beauty and an heiress, and the only daughter of people who thought themselves very distinguished indeed; so that the two had not, you might think, very much in common, and were not likely to be attracted one to the other. Yet, in spite of differing circumstances, they were close friends and allies; and had been such ever since they were together at the same fashionable school where Miss Adair was the petted favorite of all, and Janetta Colwyn was the pupil-teacher in the shabbiest of frocks, who got all the snubbing and did most of the hard work. And great offence was given in several directions by Miss Adair&#x27;s attachment to poor little Janetta.</p>

                    <p>Miss Polehampton felt her responsibility so keenly in the matter that at last she resolved to speak &quot;very seriously&quot; to her dear Margaret. She always talked of &quot;her dear Margaret,&quot; Janetta used to say, when she was going to make herself particularly disagreeable. For &quot;her dear Margaret&quot; was the pet pupil, the show pupil of the establishment: her air of perfect breeding gave distinction, Miss Polehampton thought, to the whole school; and her refinement, her exemplary behavior, her industry, and her talent formed the theme of many a lecture to less accomplished and less decorous pupils. For, contrary to all conventional expectations, Margaret Adair was not stupid, although she was beautiful and well-behaved. She was an exceedingly intelligent girl; she had an aptitude for several arts and accomplishments, and she was remarkable for the delicacy of her taste and the exquisite discrimination of which she sometimes showed herself capable. At the same time she was not as clever—(&quot;not as glaringly clever,&quot; a friend of hers once expressed it)—as little Janetta Colwyn, whose nimble wits gathered knowledge as a bee collects honey under the most unfavorable circumstances. Janetta had to learn her lessons when the other girls had gone to bed, in a little room under the roof; a room which was like an ice-house in winter and an oven in summer; she was never able to be in time for her classes, and she often missed them altogether; but, in spite of these disadvantages, she generally proved herself the most advanced pupil in her division, and if pupil-teachers had been allowed to take prizes, would have carried off every first prize in the school. This, to be sure, was not allowed. It would not have been &quot;the thing&quot; for the little governess-pupil to take away the prizes from the girls whose parents paid between two and three hundred a year for their tuition (the fees were high, because Miss Polehampton&#x27;s school was so exceedingly fashionable); therefore, Janetta&#x27;s marks were not counted, and her exercises were put aside and did not come into competition with those of the other girls, and it was generally understood amongst the teachers that, if you wished to stand well with Miss Polehampton, it would be better not to praise Miss Colwyn, but rather to put forward the merits of some charming Lady Mary or Honorable Adeliza, and leave Janetta in the obscurity from which (according to Miss Polehampton) she was fated never to emerge.</p>

                    <p>波尔汉普顿小姐对此事感到责任重大，最终决定要&quot;非常严肃地&quot;与她亲爱的玛格丽特谈话。珍妮塔常说，每当她要让自己变得特别令人讨厌时，总是会谈论&quot;她亲爱的玛格丽特&quot;。因为&quot;她亲爱的玛格丽特&quot;是这所学校的宠儿学生，是展示学生；波尔汉普顿小姐认为，她那完美的教养气质为整所学校增添了声望；她的优雅、模范行为、勤奋和才华成为了对那些不那么有成就、不那么端庄的学生进行许多次训诫的主题。因为，与所有传统期望相反，玛格丽特·阿代尔并不愚笨，尽管她美丽且行为端正。她是一个极其聪明的女孩；她在几种艺术和技能方面都有天赋，并且以其品味的精致和有时表现出的敏锐鉴别力而著称。同时，她并不像——（&quot;不像那样刺眼地聪明，&quot;她的一个朋友曾经这样表达）——小珍妮塔·科尔温那样聪明，后者敏捷的头脑在最不利的环境下也能像蜜蜂采蜜一样汲取知识。珍妮塔必须在其他女孩都上床睡觉后，在屋顶下的一个小房间里学习功课；这个房间冬天像冰窖，夏天像烤炉；她从来无法按时上课，经常完全错过课程；但是，尽管有这些不利条件，她通常证明自己是她那个年级最优秀的学生，如果允许学生教师获奖的话，她会拿走学校里的每一个一等奖。当然，这是不被允许的。让小女教师从那些父母每年为学费支付两三百英镑的女孩们手中夺走奖品，这是不&quot;合适&quot;的（学费很高，因为波尔汉普顿小姐的学校极其时髦）；因此，珍妮塔的分数不被计算，她的作业被搁置一边，不与其他女孩的作业竞争，教师们普遍理解，如果你想在波尔汉普顿小姐面前表现良好，最好不要赞扬科尔温小姐，而是要推举某位迷人的玛丽夫人或尊贵的阿德丽莎的优点，让珍妮塔留在她（根据波尔汉普顿小姐的说法）注定永远无法摆脱的默默无闻中。</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately for the purposes of the mistress of the school, Janetta was rather a favorite with the girls. She was not adored, like Margaret; she was not looked up to and respected, as was the Honorable Edith Gore; she was nobody&#x27;s pet, as the little Ladies Blanche and Rose Amberley had been ever since they set foot in the school; but she was everybody&#x27;s friend and comrade, the recipient of everybody&#x27;s confidences, the sharer in everybody&#x27;s joys or woes. The fact was that Janetta had the inestimable gift of sympathy; she understood the difficulties of people around her better than many women of twice her age would have done; and she was so bright and sunny-tempered and quick- witted that her very presence in a room was enough to dispel gloom and ill-temper. She was, therefore, deservedly popular, and did more to keep up the character of Miss Polehampton&#x27;s school for comfort and cheerfulness than Miss Polehampton herself was ever likely to be aware. And the girl most devoted to Janetta was Margaret Adair.</p>

                    <p>不幸的是，对于这位学校女主人的目的而言，珍妮塔在女孩们中颇受欢迎。她不像玛格丽特那样被崇拜；她不像尊贵的伊迪丝·戈尔那样被仰慕和尊敬；她不是任何人的宠儿，就像小布兰奇夫人和罗斯·安伯利夫人自踏进学校以来一直如此；但她是每个人的朋友和伙伴，是每个人倾诉秘密的对象，是每个人喜悦或忧愁的分享者。事实是珍妮塔拥有无价的同情天赋；她比许多年龄是她两倍的女人更能理解周围人的困难；她如此聪明、阳光、机智，以至于她在房间里的存在就足以驱散阴霾和坏脾气。因此，她理所当然地受欢迎，在维持波尔汉普顿小姐学校的舒适和愉快特色方面所做的贡献，比波尔汉普顿小姐本人可能意识到的要多。而最忠于珍妮塔的女孩就是玛格丽特·阿代尔。</p>

                    <p>&quot;留下来几分钟，玛格丽特；我想和你谈谈，&quot;波尔汉普顿小姐威严地说道，当一天晚上，就在祈祷之后，这位展示学生上前向她的老师们道晚安时。</p>

                    <p>The girls all sat round the room on wooden chairs, and Miss Polehampton occupied a high-backed, cushioned seat at a centre table while she read the portion of Scripture with which the day&#x27;s work concluded. Near her sat the governesses, English, French and German, with little Janetta bringing up the rear in the draughtiest place and the most uncomfortable chair. After prayers, Miss Polehampton and the teachers rose, and their pupils came to bid them good-night, offering hand and cheek to each in turn. There was always a great deal of kissing to be got through on these occasions. Miss Polehampton blandly insisted on kissing all her thirty pupils every evening; it made them feel more as if they were at home, she used to say; and her example was, of course, followed by the teachers and the girls.</p>

                    <p>Margaret Adair, as one of the oldest and tallest girls in the school, generally came forward first for that evening salute. When Miss Polehampton made the observation just recorded, she stepped back to a position beside her teacher&#x27;s chair in the demure attitude of a well-behaved schoolgirl—hands crossed over the wrists, feet in position, head and shoulders carefully erect, and eyes gently lowered towards the carpet. Thus standing, she was yet perfectly well aware that Janetta Colwyn gave her an odd, impish little look of mingled fun and anxiety behind Miss Polehampton&#x27;s back; for it was generally known that a lecture was impending when one of the girls was detained after prayers, and it was very unusual for Margaret to be lectured! Miss Adair did not, however, look discomposed. A momentary smile flitted across her face at Janetta&#x27;s tiny grimace, but it was instantly succeeded by the look of simple gravity becoming to the occasion.</p>

                    <p>When the last of the pupils and the last also of the teachers had filed out of the room, Miss Polehampton turned and surveyed the waiting girl with some uncertainty. She was really fond of Margaret Adair. Not only did she bring credit to the school, but she was a good, nice, lady-like girl (such were Miss Polehampton&#x27;s epithets), and very fair to look upon. Margaret was tall, slender, and exceedingly graceful in her movements; she was delicately fair, and had hair of the silkiest texture and palest gold; her eyes, however, were not blue, as one would have expected them to be; they were hazel brown, and veiled by long brown lashes—eyes of melting softness and dreaminess, peculiarly sweet in expression. Her features were a very little too long and thin for perfect beauty; but they gave her a Madonna-like look of peace and calm which many were ready enthusiastically to admire. And there was no want of expression in her face; its faint rose bloom varied almost at a word, and the thin curved lips were as sensitive to feeling as could be desired. What was wanting in the face was what gave it its peculiar maidenly charm—a lack of passion, a little lack, perhaps, of strength. But at seventeen we look less for these characteristics than for the sweetness and docility which Margaret certainly possessed. Her dress of soft, white muslin was quite simple—the ideal dress for a young girl—and yet it was so beautifully made, so perfectly finished in every detail, that Miss Polehampton never looked at it without an uneasy feeling that she was too well-dressed for a schoolgirl. Others wore muslin dresses of apparently the same cut and texture; but what the casual eye might fail to observe, the schoolmistress was perfectly well aware of, namely, that the tiny frills at neck and wrists were of the costliest Mechlin lace, that the hem of the dress was bordered with the same material, as if it had been the commonest of things; that the embroidered white ribbons with which it was trimmed had been woven in France especially for Miss Adair, and that the little silver buckles at her waist and on her shoes were so ancient and beautiful as to be of almost historic importance. The effect was that of simplicity; but it was the costly simplicity of absolute perfection. Margaret&#x27;s mother was never content unless her child was clothed from head to foot in materials of the softest, finest and best. It was a sort of outward symbol of what she desired for the girl in all relations of life.</p>

                    <p>当最后一个学生和最后一个教师都离开房间后，波尔汉普顿小姐转身带着某种不确定性审视着等待的女孩。她真的很喜欢玛格丽特·阿代尔。她不仅为学校带来了荣誉，而且她是一个好的、可爱的、淑女般的女孩（这些是波尔汉普顿小姐的形容词），而且看起来非常美丽。玛格丽特身材高挑、苗条，动作极其优雅；她肤色精致白皙，有着最柔滑质地和最淡金色的头发；然而，她的眼睛并不是人们期望的蓝色；它们是榛褐色的，被长长的棕色睫毛遮蔽着——眼神柔和梦幻，表情特别甜美。她的五官对于完美的美貌来说稍微有点太长太瘦；但它们给了她一种圣母般的平静安详的神情，许多人都热情地赞美。她的脸上并不缺乏表情；那淡淡的玫瑰红晕几乎随着一句话而变化，那薄薄的弯曲嘴唇对感情的敏感程度令人满意。这张脸所缺少的正是给它特殊少女魅力的东西——缺乏激情，也许还缺乏一点力量。但在十七岁时，我们不太寻求这些特征，而更看重玛格丽特确实拥有的甜美和温顺。她那件柔软白色细棉布的裙子非常简单——年轻女孩的理想服装——然而它制作得如此精美，每个细节都如此完美，以至于波尔汉普顿小姐每次看到它都会有一种不安的感觉，觉得对一个女学生来说她穿得太好了。其他人也穿着看似同样剪裁和质地的细棉布裙子；但是，虽然随意的眼光可能观察不到，女校长却完全清楚，即领口和袖口的小褶边是最昂贵的梅克林花边，裙子的下摆也镶着同样的材料，仿佛这是最普通的东西；装饰裙子的绣花白丝带是在法国专门为阿代尔小姐织造的，她腰间和鞋上的小银扣如此古老美丽，几乎具有历史重要性。效果是简朴的；但这是绝对完美的昂贵简朴。玛格丽特的母亲从不满足，除非她的孩子从头到脚都穿着最柔软、最精细、最好的材料。这是她对女孩在生活各个方面所期望的外在象征。</p>

The girl could not answer; she knew well enough that Janetta&#x27;s stepmother was not at all the sort of person whom Lady Caroline Adair would willingly speak to, and yet she did not like to say that her acquaintance with Janetta had only been made at a Beaminster dancing class. Probably Miss Polehampton divined the fact. &quot;Under the circumstances,&quot; she said, &quot;I think I should be justified in writing to Lady Caroline and asking her to remonstrate a little with you, my dear Margaret.

                    <p>&quot;My dear, you have no need to excite yourself. Janetta Colwyn has always been treated, I hope, with justice and kindness in this house. If you will endeavor only to make her position in life less instead of more difficult, you will be doing her the greatest favor in your power. I do not at all mean that I wish you to be unkind to her. A little more reserve, a little more caution, in your demeanor, and you will be all that I have ever wished you to be—a credit to your parents and to the school which has educated you!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;You are not equals,&quot; said Miss Polehampton, with icy displeasure in her tone—she had spoken very differently to Margaret. &quot;You have to work for your bread: there is no disgrace in that, but it puts you on a different level from that of Miss Margaret Adair, an earl&#x27;s grand-daughter, and the only child of one of the richest commoners in England. I have never before reminded you of the difference in position between yourself and the young ladies with whom you have hitherto been allowed to associate; and I really think I shall have to adopt another method—unless you conduct yourself, Miss Colwyn, with a little more modesty and propriety.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Helmsley Court was generally considered one of the prettiest houses about Beaminster; a place which was rich in pretty houses, being a Cathedral town situated in one of the most beautiful southern counties of England. The village of Helmsley was a picturesque little group of black and white cottages, with gardens full of old-fashioned flowers before them and meadows and woods behind. Helmsley Court was on slightly higher ground than the village, and its windows commanded an extensive view of lovely country bounded in the distance by a long low range of blue hills, beyond which, in clear days, it was said, keen eyes could catch a glimpse of the shining sea. The house itself was a very fine old building, with a long terrace stretching before its lower windows, and flower gardens which were the admiration of half the county. It had a picture gallery and a magnificent hall with polished floor and stained windows, and all the accessories of an antique and celebrated mansion; and it had also all the comfort and luxury that modern civilization could procure.</p>

                    <p>It was this latter characteristic that made &quot;the Court,&quot; as it was commonly called, so popular. Picturesque old houses are sometimes draughty and inconvenient, but no such defects were ever allowed to exist at the Court. Every thing went smoothly: the servants were perfectly trained: the latest improvements possible were always introduced: the house was ideally luxurious. There never seemed to be any jar or discord: no domestic worry was ever allowed to reach the ears of the mistress of the household, no cares or troubles seemed able to exist in that serene atmosphere. You could not even say of it that it was dull. For the master of the Court was a hospitable man, with many tastes and whims which he liked to indulge by having down from London the numerous friends whose fancies matched his own, and his wife was a little bit of a fine lady who had London friends too, as well as neighbors, whom she liked to entertain. The house was seldom free from visitors; and it was partly for that very reason that Lady Caroline Adair, being in her own way a wise woman, had arranged that two or three years of her daughter&#x27;s life should be spent at Miss Polehampton&#x27;s very select boarding-school at Brighton. It would be a great drawback to Margaret, she reflected, if her beauty were familiar to all the world before she came out; and really, when Mr. Adair would insist on inviting his friends constantly to the house, it was impossible to keep the girl so mewed up in the schoolroom that she would not be seen and talked of; and therefore it was better that she should go away for a time. Mr. Adair did not like the arrangement; he was very fond of Margaret, and objected to her leaving home; but Lady Caroline was gently inexorable and got her own way—as she generally did.</p>

                    <p>正是后一个特征使&quot;庄园&quot;（人们通常这样称呼它）如此受欢迎。风景如画的古老房子有时通风不良且不便，但在庄园里从不允许存在这样的缺陷。一切都进行得很顺利：仆人们训练有素：总是引入可能的最新改进：房子理想地奢华。似乎从来没有任何不和谐或争执：从不允许任何家庭烦恼传到家庭女主人的耳中，在那种宁静的氛围中似乎没有任何忧虑或麻烦能够存在。你甚至不能说它沉闷。因为庄园的主人是一个好客的人，有许多品味和奇想，他喜欢通过从伦敦请来许多与他兴趣相投的朋友来满足这些爱好，他的妻子是一个有点贵妇人的小女人，她也有伦敦的朋友以及邻居，她喜欢招待他们。房子很少没有客人；正是出于这个原因，卡罗琳·阿代尔夫人，作为一个以自己的方式明智的女人，安排她女儿生命中的两三年在布莱顿波尔汉普顿小姐非常精选的寄宿学校度过。她反思道，如果玛格丽特的美貌在她出道前就为全世界所熟悉，这对她来说将是一个很大的不利；真的，当阿代尔先生坚持不断邀请他的朋友到家里来时，不可能把女孩如此关在学校里以至于她不会被看到和谈论；因此最好让她离开一段时间。阿代尔先生不喜欢这个安排；他非常喜爱玛格丽特，反对她离开家；但卡罗琳夫人温和地坚持己见并得到了她想要的——正如她通常所做的那样。</p>

She is a much smaller woman than Margaret, and darker in complexion: it is from her, however, that Margaret inherits the large, appealing hazel eyes, which look at you with an infinite sweetness, while their owner is perhaps thinking of the menu or her milliner&#x27;s bill. Lady Caroline&#x27;s face is thin and pointed, but her complexion is still clear, and her soft brown hair is very prettily arranged. As she sits with her back to the light, with a rose-colored curtain behind her, just tinting her delicate cheek (for Lady Caroline is always careful of appearance), she looks quite a young woman still.</p>

                    <p>It is Mr. Adair whom Margaret most resembles. He is a tall and exceedingly handsome man, whose hair and moustache and pointed beard were as golden once as Margaret&#x27;s soft tresses, but are now toned down by a little grey. He has the alert blue eyes that generally go with his fair complexion, and his long limbs are never still for many minutes together. His daughter&#x27;s tranquillity seems to have come from her mother; certainly it cannot be inherited from the restless Reginald Adair.</p>

                    <p>The third person present at the breakfast-table—and, for the time being, the only visitor in the house—is a young man of seven or eight-and-twenty, tall, dark, and very spare, with a coal-black beard trimmed to a point, earnest dark eyes, and a remarkably pleasant and intelligent expression. He is not exactly handsome, but he has a face that attracts one; it is the face of a man who has quick perceptions, great kindliness of heart, and a refined and cultured mind. Nobody is more popular in that county than young Sir Philip Ashley, although his neighbors grumble sometimes at his absorption in scientific and philanthropic objects, and think that it would be more creditable to them if he went out with the hounds a little oftener or were a rather better shot. For, being shortsighted, he was never particularly fond either of sport or of games of skill, and his interest had always centred on intellectual pursuits to a degree that amazed the more countrified squires of the neighborhood.</p>

                    <p>He smiled once or twice as the day passed on at her parting injunction to him not to let her husband be dull. He had known the Adairs for many years, and had never known Reginald Adair dull under any circumstances. He was too full of interests, of &quot;fads,&quot; some people called them, ever to be dull. He took Sir Philip round the picture-gallery, round the stables, to the kennels, to the flower-garden, to his own studio (where he painted in oils when he had nothing else to do) with never-flagging energy and animation. Sir Philip&#x27;s interests lay in different grooves, but he was quite capable of sympathizing with Mr. Adair&#x27;s interests, too. The day passed pleasantly, and seemed rather short for all that the two men wanted to pack into it; although from time to time Mr. Adair would say, half-impatiently, &quot;I wonder how Caroline is getting on!&quot; or &quot;I hope she&#x27;ll bring Margaret back with her!

                    <p>He had seen a great many beautiful women, and told himself that he did not care for beauty. Fashionable, talkative women were his abomination. He had no sisters, but he loved his mother very dearly; and upon her he had founded a very high ideal of womanhood. He had begun to think vaguely, of late, that he ought to marry: duty demanded it of him, and Sir Philip was always attentive, if not obedient, to the voice of duty. But he was not inclined to marry a girl out of the schoolroom, or a girl who was accustomed to the enervating luxury (as he considered it) of Helmsley Court: he wanted an energetic, sensible, large-hearted, and large-minded woman who would be his right hand, his first minister of state. Sir Philip was fairly wealthy, but by no means enormously so; and he had other uses for his wealth than the buying of pictures and keeping up stables and kennels at an alarming expense. If Miss Adair were so pretty, he mused, it was just as well that she was not at home, for, of course, it was possible that he might find a lovely face an attraction: and much as he liked Lady Caroline, he did not want particularly to marry Lady Caroline&#x27;s daughter. That she treated him with great consideration, and that he had once overheard her speak of him as &quot;the most eligible parti of the neighborhood,&quot; had already put him a little on his guard. Lady Caroline was no vulgar, match-making mother, he knew that well enough; but she was in some respects a thoroughly worldly woman, and Philip Ashley was an essentially unworldly man.</p>

                    <p>For the drawing-room was tenanted by one figure only—that of a young lady in evening dress. Neither Lady Caroline nor Mr. Adair had appeared upon the scene; but on the hearthrug, by the small crackling fire—which, in deference to the chilliness of an English June evening, had been lighted—stood a tall, fair, slender girl, with pale complexion, and soft, loosely-coiled masses of golden hair. She was dressed in pure white, a soft loose gown of Indian silk, trimmed with the most delicate lace: it was high to the milk-white throat, but showed the rounded curves of the finely-moulded arm to the elbow. She wore no ornaments, but a white rose was fastened into the lace frill of her dress at her neck. As she turned her face towards the new comer, Sir Philip suddenly felt himself abashed. It was not that she was so beautiful—in those first few moments he scarcely thought her beautiful at all—but that she produced on him an impression of serious, virginal grace and innocence which was almost disconcerting. Her pure complexion, her grave, serene eyes, her graceful way of moving as she advanced a little to receive him stirred him to more than admiration—to something not unlike awe. She looked young; but it was youth in perfection: there was some marvelous finish, delicacy, polish, which one does not usually associate with extreme youth.</p>

                    <p>因为客厅里只有一个身影——一位穿着晚礼服的年轻女士。卡罗琳夫人和阿代尔先生都没有出现在现场；但在壁炉地毯上，在小小的噼啪作响的火旁——为了迎合英国六月晚上的寒冷而点燃的——站着一个高大、白皙、苗条的女孩，有着苍白的肤色和柔软、松散盘绕的金色头发。她穿着纯白色，一件柔软宽松的印度丝绸长袍，饰以最精致的蕾丝：高至乳白色的喉咙，但显示出精美塑造的手臂到肘部的圆润曲线。她没有戴任何装饰品，但一朵白玫瑰别在她颈部裙子的蕾丝褶边上。当她转过脸面向新来者时，菲利普爵士突然感到自己很羞愧。不是因为她如此美丽——在最初的几分钟里他几乎不认为她美丽——而是她给他留下了严肃、纯洁的优雅和天真的印象，这几乎令人不安。她纯洁的肤色，她严肃、宁静的眼睛，她优雅的移动方式，当她稍微向前迎接他时，激起了他不仅仅是钦佩——而是类似敬畏的东西。她看起来年轻；但这是完美的青春：有一些奇妙的完成度、精致、优雅，这通常不与极度的青春联系在一起。</p>

                    <p>Sir Philip turned in some curiosity to see the girl of whom he had heard for the first time that morning. He had not noticed before that she was present. He saw a brown little creature, with eyes that had been swollen with crying until they were well-nigh invisible, small, unremarkable features, and a mouth that was inclined to quiver. Margaret might afford to be serene, but to this girl expulsion from school had evidently been a sad trouble. He threw all the more kindness and gentleness into his voice and look as he spoke to her.</p>

                    <p>Janetta might have felt a little awkward if she had not been so entirely absorbed by her own woes. She had never set foot before in half so grand a house as this of Helmsley Court, nor had she ever dined late or spoken to a gentleman in an evening coat in all her previous life. The size and the magnificence of the room would perhaps have oppressed her if she had been fully aware of them. But she was for the moment very much wrapped up in her own affairs, and scarcely stopped to think of the novel situation in which she found herself. The only thing that had startled her was the attention paid to her dress by Margaret and Margaret&#x27;s maid. Janetta would have put on her afternoon black cashmere and little silver brooch, and would have felt herself perfectly well dressed; but Margaret, after a little consultation with the very grand young person who condescended to brush Miss Colwyn&#x27;s hair, had herself brought to Janetta&#x27;s room a dress of black lace over cherry-colored silk, and had begged her to put it on.</p>

She wondered whether he knew that she was only a little governess- pupil, and whether he was not angry with her for being the cause of his daughter&#x27;s abrupt departure from school. As a matter of fact, Mr. Adair knew her position exactly, and was very much amused by the whole affair; also, as it had procured him the pleasure of his daughter&#x27;s return home, he had an illogical inclination to be pleased also with Janetta. &quot;As Margaret is so fond of her, there must be something in her,&quot; he said to himself, with a critical glance at the girl&#x27;s delicate features and big dark eyes. &quot;I&#x27;ll draw her out at dinner.&quot;</p>

                    <p>He tried his best, and made himself so agreeable and amusing that Janetta lost a good deal of her shyness, and forgot her troubles. She had a quick tongue of her own, as everybody at Miss Polehampton&#x27;s was aware; and she soon found that she had not lost it. She was a good deal surprised to find that not a word was said at the dinner table about the cause of Margaret&#x27;s return: in her own home it would have been the subject of the evening; it would have been discussed from every point of view, and she would probably have been reduced to tears before the first hour was over. But here it was evident that the matter was not considered of great importance. Margaret looked serene as ever, and joined quietly in talk which was alarmingly unlike Miss Polehampton&#x27;s improving conversation: talk about county gaieties and county magnates: gossip about neighbors—gossip of a harmless although frivolous type, for Lady Caroline never allowed any talk at her table that was anything but harmless, about fashions, about old china, about music and art. Mr. Adair was passionately fond of music, and when he found that Miss Colwyn really knew something of it he was in his element. They discoursed of fugues, sonatas, concertos, quartettes, and trios, until even Lady Caroline raised her eyebrows a little at the very technical nature of the conversation; and Sir Philip exchanged a congratulatory smile with Margaret over her friend&#x27;s success. For the delight of finding a congenial spirit had brought the crimson into Janetta&#x27;s olive cheeks and the brilliance to her dark eyes: she had looked insignificant when she went in to dinner; she was splendidly handsome at dessert. Mr. Adair noticed her flashing, transitory beauty, and said to himself that Margaret&#x27;s taste was unimpeachable; it was just like his own; he had complete confidence in Margaret.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Yes, horribly hard. So Margaret, as you heard, appealed to her mother, and when Lady Caroline arrived, she found that not only were Miss Colwyn&#x27;s boxes packed, but Margaret&#x27;s as well; and that Margaret had declared that if her friend was sent away for what was after all her fault, she would not stay an hour in the house. Miss Polehampton was weeping: the girls were in revolt, the teachers in despair, so my wife thought the best way out of the difficulty was to bring both girls away at once, and settle it with Miss Colwyn&#x27;s relations afterwards. The joke is that Margaret insists on it that she has been &#x27;expelled.&#x27;&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;是的，非常苛刻。所以玛格丽特，正如你听到的，向她母亲求助，当卡罗琳夫人到达时，她发现不仅科尔温小姐的箱子打包了，玛格丽特的也打包了；玛格丽特宣布如果她的朋友因为毕竟是她的错而被送走，她一个小时也不会留在房子里。波尔汉普顿小姐在哭泣：女孩们在反抗，老师们绝望，所以我妻子认为摆脱困难的最好方法是立即把两个女孩都带走，然后与科尔温小姐的亲属解决。笑话是玛格丽特坚持说她被&#x27;开除&#x27;了。&quot;</p>

                    <p>Sir Philip was not so sure about it. In spite of his intense admiration for Margaret&#x27;s beauty, it occurred to him that the romantic partisanship of the girl with beauty, position, and wealth for her less fortunate sister had not been attended with very brilliant results. No doubt Miss Adair, reared in luxury and indulgence, did not in the least realize the harm done to the poor governess-pupil&#x27;s future by her summary dismissal from Miss Polehampton&#x27;s boarding-school. To Margaret, anything that the schoolmistress chose to say or do mattered little; to Janetta Colwyn, it might some day mean prosperity or adversity of a very serious kind. Sir Philip did not quite believe in the compensation so easily promised by Mr. Adair. He made a mental note of Miss Colwyn&#x27;s condition and prospects, and said to himself that he would not forget her. And this meant a good deal from a busy man like Sir Philip Ashley.</p>

                    <p>But when Janetta sang, Lady Caroline was, after all, rather surprised. The girl had a remarkably sweet and rich contralto voice, and it had been well trained; and, moreover, she sang with feeling and passion which were somewhat unusual in one so young. It seemed as if some hidden power, some latent characteristic came out in her singing because it found no other way of expressing itself. Neither Lady Caroline nor Margaret understood why Janetta&#x27;s voice moved them so much; Sir Philip, who came in with his host while the music was going on, heard and was charmed also without quite knowing why; it was Mr. Adair alone whose musical knowledge and experience of the world enabled him, feather-headed as in some respects he was, to lay his finger directly on the salient features of Janetta&#x27;s singing.</p>

                    <p>Sir Philip smiled and said no more. It was curious, he said to himself, to see how little conception Margaret had of lives unlike and outside her own. And Janetta&#x27;s brave but sensitive little face, with its resolute brows and lips and brilliant eyes, gave promise of a determination and an originality which, he felt convinced, would never allow her to become a mere plaything or appendage of a wealthy household, as Margaret Adair seemed to expect. But his words had made an impression. At night, when Lady Caroline and her daughter were standing in the charming little room which had always been appropriated to Margaret&#x27;s use, she spoke, with the unconscious habit of saying frankly anything that had occurred to her, of Sir Philip&#x27;s remarks.</p>

When a tap at the door announced Margaret&#x27;s appearance to say good-night, Janetta was standing before the long looking- glass, apparently inspecting herself by the light of the rose-tinted wax candles in silver sconces which were fixed on either side of the mirror.

                    <p>Miss Polehampton had, of course, written to Mr. and Mrs. Colwyn when she made up her mind that Janetta was to be removed from school; and two or three letters had been interchanged before that eventful day on which Margaret declared that if Janetta went she should go too. Margaret had been purposely kept in the dark until almost the last moment, for Miss Polehampton did not in the least wish to make a scandal, and annoyed as she was by Miss Adair&#x27;s avowed preference for Janetta, she had arranged a neat little plan by which Miss Colwyn was to go away &quot;for change of air,&quot; and be transferred to a school at Worthing kept by a relation of her own at the beginning of the following term. These plans had been upset by a foolish and ill-judged letter from Mrs. Colwyn to her stepdaughter, which Janetta had not been able to keep from Margaret&#x27;s eyes. This letter was full of reproaches to Janetta for giving so much trouble to her friends; &quot;for, of course,&quot; Mrs. Colwyn wrote, &quot;Miss Polehampton&#x27;s concern for your health is all a blind in order to get you away: and if it hadn&#x27;t been for Miss Adair taking you up, she would have been only too glad to keep you. But knowing Miss Adair&#x27;s position, she sees very clearly that it isn&#x27;t fit for you to be friends with her, and so she wants to send you away.&quot;</p>

Those men were wild about her singing. Sir Philip disapproved of her presence, but he was charmed by her voice, I could see that; and poor, dear Reginald was positively absurd about her voice.

                    <p>The victoria moved forward a little, so that Lady Caroline could obtain a clearer view of what was going on. The vehicle which caused the obstruction—evidently a hired fly from an inn—was uninjured, but the horse had fallen between the shafts and would never rise again. The occupants of the fly—a lady, and a much younger man, perhaps her son—had got out, and the lady had then turned faint, Lady Caroline heard, but was not in any way hurt. Janetta was kneeling by the side of the lady—kneeling in the dust, without any regard to the freshness of her cotton frock, by the way—and had already placed her in the right position, and was ordering the half-dozen people who had collected to stand back and give her air. Lady Caroline watched her movements and gestures with placid amusement, and went so far as to send Steel with the offer of her smelling salts; but as this offer was rejected she felt that nothing else could be done. So she sat and looked on critically.</p>

Her hair was grey, with rebellious waves in it, but her eyebrows were still dark. She was dressed in black, with a good deal of lace about her; and on her ungloved hand Lady Caroline&#x27;s keen sight enabled her to distinguish some very handsome diamond rings. The effect of the costume was a little spoiled by a large gaudy fan, of violent rainbow hues, which hung at her side; and perhaps it was this article of adornment which decided Lady Caroline in her opinion of the woman&#x27;s social status. But about the man she was equally positive in a different way. He was a gentleman: there could be no doubt of that. She put up her eye-glass and gazed at him with interest. She almost thought that she had seen him somewhere before.</p>

He was tall, muscular, and active looking: it was the way in which his black eyebrows were bent above his eyes which made the observer think him ill-tempered, for his manner and his words expressed anxiety, not anger.

Indeed, it occurred to Lady Caroline at once that there was something French about both the travelers. The lady with the frizzled grey hair, the black lace dress and mantel, the gaudy blue and scarlet fan, was quite foreign in appearance; the young man with the perfectly fitting frock- coat, the tall hat, the flower in his button-hole, was—in spite of his perfectly English accent—foreign too.

She knew, as well as Lady Caroline, that she had been stared at in a manner that was not quite agreeable to her, and yet she did not like to endorse that lady&#x27;s condemnation of the stranger.

                    <p>&quot;Yes, at number ten, Gwynne Street,&quot; said Janetta, suddenly starting and feeling a little uncomfortable. The coachman evidently knew the address already, for at that moment he turned the horse&#x27;s heads to the left, and the carriage rolled down a narrow side-street, where the tall red brick houses had a mean and shabby aspect, and seemed as if constructed to keep out sun and air as much as possible.</p>

                    <p>Janetta always felt the closeness and the shabbiness a little when she first came home, even from school, but when she came from Helmsley Court they struck her with redoubled force. She had never thought before how dull the street was, nor noticed that the railings were broken down in front of the door with the brass-plate that bore her father&#x27;s name, nor that the window-curtains were torn and the windows sadly in need of washing. The little flight of stone steps that led from the iron gate to the door was also very dirty; and the servant girl, whose head appeared against the area railings as the carriage drove up, was more untidy, more unkempt, in appearance than ever Janetta could have expected. &quot;We can&#x27;t be rich, but we might be clean!&quot; she said to herself in a subdued frenzy of impatience, as she fancied (quite unjustly) that she saw a faint smile pass over Lady Caroline&#x27;s delicate, impassive face. &quot;No wonder she thinks me an unfit friend for dear Margaret. But—oh, there is my dear, darling father! Well, nobody can say anything against him at any rate!&quot; And Janetta&#x27;s face beamed with sudden joy as she saw Mr. Colwyn coming down the dirty steps to the ricketty little iron gate, and Lady Caroline, who knew the surgeon by sight, nodded to him with friendly condescension.</p>

                    <p>On the evening of the day on which Lady Caroline drove with Janetta Colwyn to Beaminster, the lady who had fainted by the wayside was sitting in a rather gloomy- looking room at Brand Hall—a room known in the household as the Blue Drawing- room. It had not the look of a drawing-room exactly: it was paneled in oak, which had grown black with age, as had also the great oak beams that crossed the ceiling and the polished floor. The furniture also was of oak, and the hangings of dark but faded blue, while the blue velvet of the chairs and the square of Oriental carpet, in which blue tints also preponderated, did not add cheerfulness to the scene. One or two great blue vases set on the carved oak mantel-piece, and some smaller blue ornaments on a sideboard, matched the furniture in tint; but it was remarkable that on a day when country gardens were overflowing with blossom, there was not a single flower or green leaf in any of the vases. No smaller and lighter ornaments, no scrap of woman&#x27;s handiwork—lace or embroidery—enlivened the place: no books were set upon the table. A fire would not have been out of season, for the evenings were chilly, and it would have had a cheery look; but there was no attempt at cheeriness. The woman who sat in one of the high- backed chairs was pale and sad: her folded hands lay listlessly clasped together on her lap, and the sombre garb that she wore was as unrelieved by any gleam of brightness as the room itself. In the gathering gloom of a chilly summer evening, even the rings upon her fingers could not flash. Her white face, in its setting of rough, wavy grey hair, over which she wore a covering of black lace, looked almost statuesque in its profound tranquillity. But it was not the tranquillity of comfort and prosperity that had settled on that pale, worn, high-featured face—it was rather the tranquillity that comes of accepted sorrow and inextinguishable despair.</p>

He had been dining, but he was not in evening dress, and there was something unrestful and reckless in his way of moving round the room and throwing himself in the chair nearest his mother&#x27;s, which roused Mrs. Brand&#x27;s attention. She turned slightly towards him, and became conscious at once of the fumes of wine and strong tobacco with which her son had made her only too familiar. She looked at him for a moment, then clasped her hands tightly together and resumed her former position, with her sad face turned to the window. She may have breathed a sigh as she did so, but Wyvis Brand did not hear it, and if he had heard it, would not perhaps have very greatly cared.</p>

                    <p>Brand Hall had been practically deserted for the last few years. A tenant or two had occupied it for a little time soon after its late master&#x27;s withdrawal from the country; but the house was inconvenient and remote from towns, and it was said, moreover, to be damp and unhealthy. A caretaker and his wife had, therefore, been its only inhabitants of late, and a great deal of preparation had been required to make it fit for its owner when he at last wrote to his agents in Beaminster to intimate his intention of settling at the Hall.</p>

                    <p>The Brands had for many a long year been renowned as the most unlucky family in the neighborhood. They had once possessed a great property in the county; but gambling losses and speculation had greatly reduced their wealth, and even in the time of Wyvis Brand&#x27;s grandfather the prestige of the family had sunk very low. In the days of Mark Brand, the father of Wyvis, it sank lower still. Mark Brand was not only &quot;wild,&quot; but weak: not only weak, but wicked. His career was one of riotous dissipation, culminating in what was generally spoken of as &quot;a low marriage&quot;—with the barmaid of a Beaminster public-house. Mary Wyvis had never been at all like the typical barmaid of fiction or real life: she was always pale, quiet, and refined-looking, and it was not difficult to see how she had developed into the sorrowful, careworn woman whom Wyvis Brand called mother; but she came of a thoroughly bad stock, and was not untouched in reputation. The county people cut Mark Brand after his marriage, and never took any notice of his wife; and they were horrified when he insisted on naming his eldest son after his wife&#x27;s family, as if he gloried in the lowliness of her origin. But when Wyvis was a small boy, his father resolved that neither he nor his children should be flouted and jeered at by county magnates any longer. He went abroad, and remained abroad until his death, when Wyvis was twenty years of age and Cuthbert, the younger son, was barely twelve. Some people said that the discovery of some particularly disgraceful deed was imminent when he left his native shores, and that it was for this reason that he had never returned to England; but Mark Brand himself always spoke as if his health were too weak, his nerves too delicate, to bear the rough breezes of his own country and the brusque manners of his compatriots. He had brought up his son according to his own ideas; and the result did not seem entirely satisfactory. Vague rumors occasionally reached Beaminster of scrapes and scandals in which the young Brands figured; it was said that Wyvis was a particularly black sheep, and that he did his best to corrupt his younger brother Cuthbert. The news that he was coming back to Brand Hall was not received with enthusiasm by those who heard it.</p>

                    <p>布兰德家族多年来一直以附近最不幸的家族而闻名。他们曾经在郡里拥有大量财产；但赌博损失和投机大大减少了他们的财富，甚至在威维斯·布兰德祖父的时代，家族的声望就已经沉得很低。在威维斯的父亲马克·布兰德的时代，它沉得更低。马克·布兰德不仅&quot;放荡&quot;，而且软弱：不仅软弱，而且邪恶。他的职业生涯是放荡的挥霍，最终达到通常被称为&quot;低贱婚姻&quot;的顶点——与比明斯特一家酒馆的女招待结婚。玛丽·威维斯从来不像小说或现实生活中典型的女招待：她总是苍白、安静、看起来优雅，不难看出她是如何发展成威维斯·布兰德称为母亲的悲伤、忧虑的女人；但她出身于彻底坏的血统，名声也不清白。郡里的人在马克·布兰德结婚后与他断绝关系，从不理会他的妻子；当他坚持以他妻子的家族命名他的长子时，他们感到震惊，仿佛他为她出身的卑微而自豪。但当威维斯还是个小男孩时，他父亲决定他和他的孩子们不应该再被郡里的显贵们嘲笑和讥讽。他出国了，一直待在国外直到他去世，那时威维斯二十岁，小儿子卡斯伯特刚满十二岁。有些人说，当他离开祖国时，某些特别可耻的行为的发现即将来临，正是因为这个原因他从未回到英格兰；但马克·布兰德本人总是说话好像他的健康太虚弱，神经太脆弱，无法承受自己国家的粗糙微风和同胞的粗鲁举止。他按照自己的想法抚养儿子；结果似乎并不完全令人满意。模糊的谣言偶尔传到比明斯特，关于年轻的布兰德们卷入的麻烦和丑闻；据说威维斯是一只特别黑的羊，他尽力腐蚀他的弟弟卡斯伯特。他要回到布兰德庄园的消息没有被听到的人热情接受。</p>

                    <p>Wyvis&#x27; own story had been a sad one—perhaps more sad than scandalous; but it was a story that the Beaminster people were never to hear aright. Few knew it, and most of those who knew it had agreed to keep it secret. That his wife and child were living, many persons in Paris were aware; that they had separated was also known, but the reason of that separation was to most persons a secret. And Wyvis, who had a great dislike to chatterers, made up his mind when he came to Beaminster that he would tell to nobody the history of the past few years. Had it not been for his mother&#x27;s sad face, he fancied that he could have put it out of his mind altogether. He half resented the pertinacity with which she seemed to brood upon it. The fact that she had forwarded— had almost insisted upon—the unfortunate marriage, weighed heavily upon her mind. There had been a point at which Wyvis would have given it up. But his mother had espoused the side of the girl, persuaded the young man to fulfill his promises to her— and repented it ever since. Mrs. Wyvis Brand had developed an uncontrollable love for strong drink, as well as a temper that made her at times more like a mad woman than an ordinary human being; and when she one day disappeared from her husband&#x27;s home, carrying his child with her, and announcing in a subsequent letter that she did not mean to return, it could hardly be wondered at if Wyvis drew a long breath of relief, and hoped that she never would.</p>

                    <p>威维斯自己的故事是悲伤的——也许更多的是悲伤而不是丑闻；但这是比明斯特人永远不会正确听到的故事。很少有人知道它，大多数知道的人都同意保守秘密。他的妻子和孩子还活着，巴黎的许多人都知道；他们已经分居也是已知的，但分居的原因对大多数人来说是秘密。威维斯，对喋喋不休的人有很大的厌恶，当他来到比明斯特时下定决心，他不会向任何人讲述过去几年的历史。如果不是因为他母亲悲伤的脸，他想他可以完全把它从脑海中抹去。他半怨恨她似乎固执地沉思它。她曾经促进——几乎坚持——那场不幸的婚姻，这个事实沉重地压在她心上。曾经有一个时刻威维斯会放弃它。但他母亲支持了那个女孩，说服年轻人履行对她的承诺——从那以后一直后悔。威维斯·布兰德夫人发展出对烈酒无法控制的爱好，以及有时让她更像疯女人而不是普通人的脾气；当她有一天从她丈夫的家中消失，带着他的孩子，并在随后的信中宣布她不打算回来时，如果威维斯长长地松了一口气，希望她永远不会回来，这几乎不足为奇。</p>

                    <p>Janetta colored, and turned away. Meanwhile Mrs. Colwyn had dropped into the nearest arm-chair, and Mr. Colwyn strayed in and out of the room with the expression of a dog that has lost its master. Georgie hung upon Janetta&#x27;s arm, and the younger children either clung to their elder sister, or stared at her with round eyes and their fingers in their mouths. Janetta felt uncomfortably conscious of being more than usually interesting to them all. Joe, the eldest boy, a dusty lad of fourteen, all legs and arms, favored her with a broad grin expressive of delight, which his sister did not understand. It was Tiny, the most gentle and delicate of the tribe, who let in a little light on the subject.</p>
